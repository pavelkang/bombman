Here is a list of things I think we need to do in the future. We have the structure set up already most of them shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to finish.
1. Add points when bomb is in safezone
2. Collision between bombs and boundaries (this one can take more time) - partially implemented, bug - sometimes bombs get through anyway. should be a simple fix.
3. Mechanism to produce bombs (the frequency at which we produce the bombs should increase as the player gets higher score. should also randomly decide whether they come from the top or bottom)
4. game over scene
5. game start scene
6. GRAPHICS and SOUND
7. try bomb walk with animation

Bugs:
1. all bombs freeze when dragging and dropping a single bomb
2. bombs sometimes escape from safezone
3. bombs sometimes break through canvas boundaries (same bug as 2)


1. add points
2. frequency
3. two colors of bombs (pink)
